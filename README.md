##  Azure Machine Learning and MLOps

The described MLOps capabilities are provided by Azure Machine Learning:

- **Machine Learning pipelines** for your data preparation, training, and scoring processes, allowing you to define repeatable and reusable steps.
- **Create reusable software environments** for developing and using models.
- **Register, package, and deploy models** from anywhere.Â  The associated metadata needed to use the model can also be tracked.
- **Capture the governance data** for the full lifecycle of ML. Who is publishing the models, the reasons for changes, and the dates that the models were deployed or used in production can all be included in the logged information.
- **Notify and alert on events in the ML lifecycle**. Examples include data drift detection, model registration, model deployment, and experiment completion.
- **Monitor ML applications for operational and ML-related issues**. Examine model-specific metrics, compare model inputs between training and inference, and offer monitoring and alerts for your ML infrastructure.
- **Automate the end-to-end ML lifecycle with Azure Machine Learning and Azure Pipelines**.By using pipelines, you can continuously roll out new ML models alongside your other applications and services while also frequently updating models, testing new models, and doing so.
